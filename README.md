# Linux+ study notes
This repo contains my study notes for the Linux+ exam. Notes are in a fairly raw, messy format - mainly my stream of consciousness while reviewing and studying my certification course materials. 

This set of notes will not be exhaustive. I previously wrote the LPI Linux Essentials certification, and there is a lot of overlap between LPI LE and Linux+ for basic administration tasks. Therefore, if a topic is left out here it is because I already have notes in another repository.
